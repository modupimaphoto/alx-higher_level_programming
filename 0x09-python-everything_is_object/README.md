# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

### What is an object:

In Python, everything is an object. An object is a instance of a particular class or type, and it can have attributes (characteristics) and methods (functions associated with it).

### Difference between a class and an object or instance:

- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have.
- An object or instance is a specific instantiation of a class. It is created based on the class blueprint and represents a unique entity.

### Difference between immutable and mutable objects:

Mutable objects: Can be modified or changed after creation. Lists, dictionaries, and sets are examples of mutable objects.

Immutable objects: Cannot be modified once created. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.

### What is a reference:

A reference is a way to access the memory location of an object. In Python, variables are references to objects.

### What is an assignment:

Assignment is the process of binding a name to a value in Python. It associates a variable with a specific object.

### What is an alias:

An alias occurs when two or more variables refer to the same object. Changes made through one variable will affect the object, and those changes will be visible through the other variables.
