# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects, which are instances of classes, to design and organize code. OOP revolves around the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, providing a modular and structured approach to software development.

## “First-class everything”:
This phrase refers to the fact that in Python, everything is treated as an object and can be manipulated like one. Functions, classes, and even modules are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.

## What is a class:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.

## What is an object and an instance:
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but when it is instantiated (i.e., an object is created), memory is allocated.
